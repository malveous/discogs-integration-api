Integration API for Discogs using Java

The database is built in MySQL and a script is included in src/main/resources to be executed.

Unfortunately, due to the time frame and some limitations I was not able to fully complete the challenge, I might dedicate some time to complete it soon, I really liked the challenge, but I am running out of time for some responsabilities with my current job.

I would have liked to add tests, but I managed to finish source code just in time, but I know how to implement Unit Tests (you can see user storage project repository included in my account)

Thanks and sorry for the inconveniences.
